                        <h5>Who is Elon Musk?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
                            businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became
                            PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
                            multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up
                            company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made
                            headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would
                            send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space
                            Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of
                            SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of
                            industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of
                            President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk
                            reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the
                            world.

                        <h5>Education</h5>
                        <p>
                            At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s
                            University and avoid mandatory service in the South African
                            military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in
                            part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American
                            citizenship via that path. In 1992, Musk left Canada to study
                            business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He
                            graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed
                            for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. After leaving Penn,
                            Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD
                            in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with
                            the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two
                            days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2
                            Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.
